# blog

A simple blog I don't keep updated with a google map of everywhere I traveled to on my round the world trip of a year(2013-2014).

I also created a private budgeting system I used to save up for my trip.

The site can be viewed at www.dsauerbrun.com and if you would like access to the budgeting module let me know.
